# ICRA_2023
This is the repository containing the codes we used in our ICRA23 paper. 


You can find the Kilobot .C code, together with the binary .hex codes in the "Kilobot_codes" folder.

Note: We assigned distinct IDs to each Kilobot when we unboxed them! This helps them to distinguished messages received from different robots. If your robots don't have different IDs, then there is a chance for miscalculation of the local average in the consensus phase. 

ToDo: add citation text here.

To be added later: the python codes used for post-processing the videos.
